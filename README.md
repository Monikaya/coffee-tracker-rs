# Coffee-Tracker-rs
 
Quick little thing I got inspired to make because I wanted to learn **Rust**.
I got pushed to create this because of [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) which seems kinda awesome. Maybe I'll finally get some learning done!

## TODO

- [ ] Literally Everything

### Short Term

- [ ] Make it usable
- [ ] Make it fun
- [ ] Visuals

### Long Term (may never happen idk)

- [ ] Create releases
- [ ] Add some form of Fire/Supabase or SQL integration.
- [ ] Make it accessible on either the web or on Android.
- [ ] Possibly genuine GUI? This is low priority
